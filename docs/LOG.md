# Hillclimb log

The engineering journal. Every step: hypothesis, change, measured numbers, how far
we are from the ceiling, and what surprised us. Numbers come from
`cargo run --release -p nanoinfer-cli -- bench ...` on the machine below and are
also in `bench/results.jsonl` (one JSON line per run, with git sha).

**Machine:** Apple M4 (base, 4P + 6E cores), 24 GB unified memory, macOS.
**Model:** GPT-2 124M (`openai-community/gpt2`), f32 weights, 1 thread.
**Bench defaults:** prompt 64 tokens, 1 warmup + 5 timed runs, median ± stddev.
The bench thread asks for QoS `USER_INTERACTIVE` so macOS keeps it on a
performance core (see the Stage 1 surprises).

## The ceiling

Decoding one token at batch size 1 has to stream every weight from memory once.
Nothing can be faster than:

```
decode ceiling = memory bandwidth / bytes of weights read per token
               = 120 GB/s / 494.6 MB  ≈ 243 tok/s   (f32)
```

494.6 MB = all 12 blocks' matrices and biases (85.0M params) plus the full
50257 × 768 token embedding, which doubles as the LM head (38.6M params), at 4
bytes each. The position table is excluded (only one row is read per token).
120 GB/s is Apple's spec figure for the base M4. Stream benchmarks typically
reach 85–90% of spec, so the *practical* ceiling is closer to ~210 tok/s. We
plot against the spec number and say so.

This ceiling only falls if we read fewer bytes per token: smaller dtypes (f16
halves it, int8 quarters it) or batching (several sequences share one read
of the weights).

| Stage | Prefill tok/s | Decode tok/s | % of decode ceiling | Speed-up vs prev |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 naive | 26.16 ± 0.31 | 0.368 ± 0.003 | 0.15% | — |
| 1 kv-cache | 27.06 ± 0.43 | 18.95 ± 0.16 | 7.8% | 51× decode |

(prompt 64 tokens, 16 decode steps for both rows, so they're directly comparable.)

## Stage 0: naive

**Hypothesis.** The simplest correct forward pass, recomputing the whole sequence
for every new token, will be correct but terribly slow at decode, and its decode
speed will fall as the context grows, because each token costs a full forward over
`context_len` rows.

**What it is.** `crates/core/src/stages/naive.rs`. Scalar f32 kernels
(`kernels/reference.rs`): a triple-loop matmul with one accumulator per output, a
straightforward layernorm, tanh-GELU, and causal attention that materialises scores
per (query, head). No caching, no SIMD, no threads, default release profile (no LTO,
no `target-cpu=native`). Only the last position's logits are computed: an
inference engine never needs the others.

**Correctness.** Last-position logits match HF transformers (f32, eager attention)
on 4 prompts with max |diff| between 7.6e-5 and 1.8e-4 (test tolerance 1e-3). Greedy
generation matches HF token for token.

**Numbers** (`bench --stage naive --prompt-len 64 --tokens 16 --runs 3`):

| | tok/s |
|---|---|
| prefill (64 tokens, one forward) | 26.16 ± 0.31 |
| decode (context 64 → 80) | 0.368 ± 0.003 |
| % of 243 tok/s ceiling | 0.15% |

**Reading the numbers.** Decode ≈ prefill ÷ average context: 26.2 / ~72 ≈ 0.36.
Each "decode" step *is* a prefill of the whole context, so generating token 80 costs
80× generating token 1. Generating N tokens is O(N²) total.

**What surprised me.**
- Prefill isn't faster per token than a single forward. In theory prefill reuses each
  weight across 64 rows, so it should be compute-dense and fast. Our matmul loop
  order (for each row → for every weight row → dot product) streams the whole weight
  matrix again for every input row, so it gets no reuse at all. Blocking or tiling the
  matmul to reuse weights across rows is a future stage, and it's a *prefill*
  optimisation, not a decode one.
- The scalar matmul runs at about 4.6 GFLOP/s. That's more than one FMA latency chain
  should allow (~2.2 GFLOP/s at ~4 cycles per dependent FMA, 4.4 GHz). The M4's
  out-of-order core overlaps the *next* output's independent dot product with the
  current one. That's free ILP, not compiler vectorisation: LLVM can't reorder a
  float reduction without fast-math.

**Learner notes.**
- The "stupid" version is worth writing. It's the oracle every later stage is tested
  against, and its cost curve (quadratic) is the motivation for the KV cache.
- The causal mask is not a matrix of -inf. It's just a loop bound: query `p` looks at
  keys `0..=p`.
- HF GPT-2 stores linear weights as `[in, out]` (`Conv1D`). We transpose to `[out, in]`
  at load so every dot product walks memory contiguously.

## Stage 1: KV cache

**Hypothesis.** Old positions are only ever used through their keys and values in
attention, and those never change (causal attention). If each layer caches K and V,
a decode step only pushes 1 row through the matmuls instead of `context_len` rows.
Decode should speed up by roughly the average context length (~70× here), minus the
LM head, which both stages pay once per token anyway.

**What changed.** `crates/core/src/stages/kv_cache.rs`: a `[n_layer, max_seq, C]` cache
for K and V (72 MiB at the full 1024 context). The forward runs only the new tokens,
appends their K/V rows to the cache, and attends over the cache. The kernels are
unchanged (same `Reference` set). The `attention` kernel was written from day one to
take K/V as `(slice, stride)`, so the same function reads from the fused QKV buffer
(naive) or from the cache (kv-cache).

**Correctness.** Same logits as HF (identical max |diff| to naive: the arithmetic per row
is the same). A test feeds prompts one token at a time through the cache, and another
checks naive and kv-cache agree on every step of a 6-token greedy decode.

**Numbers:**

| run | prefill tok/s | decode tok/s | % ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| prompt 64, 16 decode steps | 27.06 ± 0.43 | **18.95 ± 0.16** | 7.8% |
| prompt 64, 64 decode steps | 26.92 ± 0.30 | 18.83 ± 0.24 | 7.8% |
| same, `--with-trace` (Recorder + `Instant` per op) | 26.78 ± 0.24 | 18.59 ± 0.12 | 7.7% |
| prompt 512, 256 decode steps | 24.78 ± 0.96 | 17.38 ± 0.54 | 7.2% |

**51× decode speed-up** at context ~64–80. Prefill is unchanged, as expected: the
prompt is one forward either way.

Where a decode token's time goes (`generate --profile`, kv-cache, short context):

| op | share | GFLOP/s | GB/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| lm_head (768 → 50257) | 29% | 5.0 | 10.0 |
| fc_proj (3072 → 768) | 26% | 4.1 | 8.1 |
| fc (768 → 3072) | 22% | 4.9 | 9.9 |
| qkv (768 → 2304) | 16% | 4.9 | 9.9 |
| attn_proj (768 → 768) | 5.5% | 4.9 | 9.8 |
| attention, layernorms, gelu, residuals, kv writes | <1% | | |

**What surprised me.**
- **Decode isn't memory-bound yet.** The textbook line is "decode is memory-bound". Ours
  moves ~10 GB/s out of 120. It's bound by scalar FMA latency, at the same ~4.7
  GFLOP/s as prefill. Memory-boundness is something you *earn* with fast enough
  kernels. Until then, FLOPs are the bottleneck everywhere. This is the setup for the
  SIMD stage: the roofline dot for stage 1 sits far under the compute roof, not
  against the bandwidth slope.
- **Prefill is faster per token than decode** (27 vs 19 tok/s) even though prefill
  gets no weight reuse. The difference is the LM head: decode pays the full
  768×50257 projection (31% of all weights) for every token, prefill pays it once per
  prompt. On a 124M model the embedding table is a third of the model. On a 7B model
  it's ~2%.
- **Attention is invisible at this size.** <1% of decode time at short context, and only
  ~8% slower decode at context 512–768. The O(n) attention term only matters at much
  longer contexts or once the matmuls are fast.
- **fc_proj is ~20% slower than fc** despite identical FLOPs. fc_proj does 768 dot
  products of length 3072. fc does 3072 of length 768. Hypothesis: shorter
  independent chains give the out-of-order core more overlap at chain boundaries. To
  verify when we touch the matmul.
- **macOS scheduled the benchmark on an efficiency core.** Before setting thread QoS,
  consecutive runs gave 19.2, 9.8, 6.5, 15.9, 17.9 tok/s (stddev 4.6) on a loaded
  machine. With `pthread_set_qos_class_self_np(USER_INTERACTIVE)` it was 18.7 ± 0.6
  under the same load. Benchmark hygiene first, optimisation second.
- **Tracing is ~free.** With a timing `Recorder` attached (≈135 `Instant::now()` pairs
  per token), decode was 18.59 vs 18.83 tok/s (−1.3%, about one stddev). With
  `NoTrace` the trace calls are compiled out entirely (`T::ENABLED` is a `const`).

**Learner notes.**
- The KV cache trades memory for compute: 2 × layers × context × d_model floats. For
  GPT-2 small at full context that's 72 MiB, about 15% of the weights. For a 70B model
  with long contexts and many users, KV-cache memory, not weights, limits batch size.
  Hence paged attention, GQA/MQA, KV quantisation (later chapters).
- With the cache, decode does *exactly* one row of matmul per layer per token, so
  weight bytes per token are fixed. That's what makes the bandwidth ceiling a
  meaningful target from here on.

**Next.** We're at 7.8% of the ceiling, compute-latency-bound. The next steps attack FLOP
throughput: multiple accumulators / SIMD in the matmul (NEON, 4 lanes × several
accumulators), then threads, then reduce bytes (f16/int8) once we are actually
bandwidth-bound.
